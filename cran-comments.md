## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Replaced `\dontrun{}` with `\donttest{}` in the examples of `hsar.Rd` and `sar.Rd`.

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This release resolves the CRAN check issues for `HASR` and announces Wenbo Lv as the new maintainer.
